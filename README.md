## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict employee salaries based on various factors such as experience, education, job role, and geographic location. The model leverages data-driven techniques to provide accurate salary predictions, which can be used by organizations to enhance their salary structuring and recruitment strategies.

# Features
   i.Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing feature engineering.
  ii.Modeling: Implementing various algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
 iii.Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to enhance model accuracy.
  iv.Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
